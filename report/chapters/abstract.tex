\section*{\centering Abstract}

This paper looks in the continuous deployment with a focus on architecture such a system from the ground up. Starting with where it came from, what it is and the technologies used. Then looking at what an ideal continuous deployment system would be all the way from developer to user. With a quick look at the cost-benefits and who would benefit from such a system. Then taking a look at what is missing, seeing that in general the tools and technology used is on the right rack and destined for success. However, the embedded systems and continuous deployment seem to be out of sync and more tools need to be created to aid this area into being brought up with rest.
